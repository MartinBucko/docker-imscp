# i-MSCP 1.4.x Serie -- Errata

First of all, if you're updating from a older i-MSCP Serie, you should read the archived errata files that you can
find in the ./docs directory of the i-MSCP archive.

## Version 1.4.0

### i-MSCP log files

There is now only one log file per module. In other words, event logging is now made on a per module basis. Before,
event logging was made on a per item basis, possibly leading to hundred files stored in the /var/log/imscp directory.

There are no reasons to keep logs for all processed items. Generally speaking, administrator only has interest for logs
of last processed item, mostly when there was an error raised.

### Passwords storage

All passwords are now stored using a scheme other than `PLAIN` to prevent anybody with access to the i-MSCP database
(such as a hacker) from stealing users' passwords and using them to access other services.

#### Ftp user passwords

The `rawpasswd` plaintext password column has been removed from the i-MSCP database. The password scheme for FTP users
is still unchanged (SHA512-crypt).

####Â Mail account passwords

New password scheme for Mail accounts is `SHA512-crypt`. We chose SHA512-crypt because it is supported by all software
products integrated with i-MSCP. Update is automatic. Mail account passwords will be hashed automatically during upgrade.

Be aware that due to this change, only the `plaintext` authentication mechanisms (PLAIN, LOGIN) are now supported. This
is due to the fact that non-plaintext authentication mechanisms require either plaintext passwords or password scheme
that belongs to the chosen authentication mechanism. To avoid problems with plaintext passwords that are sent during
authentication processes, it is recommended to use SSL/TLS connections only.

You must not forget to inform your customers about this change. Mail clients configured to use authentication
mechanisms such as MD5-CRAM will fail to authenticate.

#### SQL user passwords

The `sqlu_pass` plaintext password column has been removed from the i-MSCP database.

### PHP alternatives (Debian only)

It is now possible to choose alternative PHP versions through the installer. For instance, under Debian Jessie, it is
possible to choose between PHP 5.6 (default), or PHP 7.0 (provided through Dotdeb repository).

You can switch to an alternative PHP version by running the following commands:

    # cd <imscp_archive_dir>
    # perl imscp-autoinstall -dr php

Note that alternative PHP versions are not a replacement for the PhpSwitcher plugin. They only allow change of the
default PHP version (a.k.a. system PHP version). Without the PhpSwitcher plugin, there is no way to provide multiple
PHP versions to customers.

### PhpMyAdmin and Pydio auto-login feature

The auto-login feature providing customers with a button to auto-logon in PhpMyAdmin or Pydio without having to provide
login data has been removed. One of requirement for that feature are plaintext passwords that are now removed for
security reasons. An alternative method will be implemented in a later release.

### Postfix SASL authentication backend

SASL authentication backend used by the Postfix MTA depends on the PO server in use (Dovecot or Courier).

- Courier: Postfix MTA uses Cyrus SASL as authentication backend. Courier authentication library (authdaemon) is used as
password verifier.
- Dovecot: Postfix MTA uses Dovecot SASL as authentication backend.
